# Kario-Mart
Maybe it's too simple for some people, but for others simple is elegant and fun. Kario Mart is a free for all.
You run around, collect random powerups that either attack other people's scores or increase yours. Watch out for the
killer soundeffects and psychedelic flashes of color announcing when a powerup has been executed. 

Player one: w-a-s-d and q (powerup)
Player two: i-j-k-l and u (powerup)

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 rfk 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
